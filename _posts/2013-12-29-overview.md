The API is built with the design principles of REST in mind, exposing resources which can be manipulated using the HTTP methods **`GET`**, **`POST`**, **`PUT`** and **`DELETE`**.
Every call requires a valid Consumer Key to be passed with all requests. You can get a Consumer Key by registering your app. Once you have a key, you can pass it as a parameter into your requests. With your consumer key, you can access all the public resources. To access private resources, you need to authenticate the user with [OAuth](#/oauth).

### Endpoint

All the resources on MuseScore.com are accessible via the following endpoint
```http://api.musescore.com/services/rest```

### Return format
