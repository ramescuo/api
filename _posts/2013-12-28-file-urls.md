### Score Files URLs

You can construct the source URL to score fles once you know its ID and its secret, as returned by many API methods.

The URL takes the following format:
```http://static.musescore.com/{id}/{secret}/score.{extension}```
Where _extension_ can be anything in _pdf_, _mid_ (General MIDI), _mxl_ ([Compressed MusicXML](http://www.recordare.com/xml/compressed-mxl.html)), _mscz_ ([MuseScore](http://musescore.org) file), _mp3_.

For sets of files, such as PNGs the URL takes the following format: 
```http://static.musescore.com/{id}/{secret}/score_{page_number}.png```
Where *{page_number}* is a zero-indexed integer.

A thumbnail is available for each score at: 
```http://static.musescore.com/{id}/{secret}/thumb.png```

PNG files are transparent and with 100dpi resolution.
