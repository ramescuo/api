The resolve resource allows you to lookup and access API resources when you only know the MuseScore.com URL.

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl http://api.musescore.com/services/rest/resolve.xml?url=http://musescore.com/nicolas/scores/583&oauth_consumer_key=your_consumer_key
< HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
< Location: http://api.musescore.com/services/rest/score/583.xml?oauth_consumer_key=your_consumer_key
{% endhighlight %}


This request will resolve and redirect to the API resource URL for the score [http://musescore.com/nicolas/scores/583](http://musescore.com/nicolas/scores/583). Just follow the redirect and you will get the representation you want. 

The resolver supports URLs for:

* Score
* User
